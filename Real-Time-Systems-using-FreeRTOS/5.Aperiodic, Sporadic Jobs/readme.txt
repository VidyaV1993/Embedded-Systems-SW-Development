- Given the task sets 1 and 2. Simulate them in SimSo and find out the utilization factor, response time and check whether any of the jobs missed the deadline.
- Task set 1: T1(2, 0.5), T2(3, 1.2), T3(6, 0.5) and the RM scheduler
- Task set 2: T1(2, 0.5, 1.9) T2(5, 2) T3(1, 0.1, 0.5) T4(10, 5, 20) and the EDF scheduler
