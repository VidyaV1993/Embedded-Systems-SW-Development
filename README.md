# Embedded Systems Programming

This repository consists of various embedded systems programming exercises and projects done using ARM Cortex M3/4 based stm32 microcontroller.

Hardware:
- ARM Cortex M4 based STM32F407 DISCOVERY board from ST is used.
- Alternatively any other boards from ST such as Nucleo or evaluation can be used.

Software:
- Eclipse-based STM32CubeIDE is used as the  IDE 

Sub-repositories:
- Microcontroller Embedded C Programming - Part 1
- Embedded Systems Programming on ARM Cortex-M3/M4 Processor
